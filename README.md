# DEPRECATED
As a user, check out [foo_dsp_vst3](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_dsp_vst3). It's better.

As a developer, you may find a couple useful workarounds against limitations of FB2K API here, but don't put too much hope into fixing this adapter. It would have to be rewritten from scratch with sandboxing and VST3 support, which is basically [foo_dsp_vst3](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_dsp_vst3) anyway.
